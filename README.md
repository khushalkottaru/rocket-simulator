# 2D Rocket Trajectory Simulator

A Python script that simulates the 2D flight path of a powered rocket, factoring in gravity, aerodynamic drag, wind, thrust, and variable mass.

## Features
-   Models forces like gravity, drag, and wind.
-   Uses a time-step simulation to calculate the flight path.
-   Considers when the engine is on and calculates thrust
-   Simulates variable mass as fuel is consumed
-   Generates a detailed plot of the trajectory using Matplotlib.

## How to Run
1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Create and activate a virtual environment.
3.  Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4.  Run the simulation: `python3 main.py`
